# Self Signed SSL certificate

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a clientâ€”typically a web server (website) and a browser, or a mail server and a mail client. SSL allows sensitive information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, and login credentials to be transmitted securely. 

Why SSL exists?
1. Encryption- Hiding what is sent from one computer to another computer.
2. Identification- Making sure the computer you are speaking to is the one you trust.

SSL certificates are a tool that provides website protection and guarantees the confidentiality of data transmitted electronically. Full security is a result of the use of encrypted communication between computers. SSL certificates are registered on a particular domain name that contains information about the domain owner, his address, etc. This data is cryptographically protected and cannot be independently changed.
